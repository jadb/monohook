# Monohook - Git hooks in PHP

A re-visited approach to [Git hooks][githooks] - and probably other like Mercurial or Subversion?

## Install

Monohook can be installed using [Composer][composer]:

```
composer require --dev jadb/monohook:dev-master
```

## Usage

Now that you have the package installed, you just need to create your hooks and symlink them to
the `.monohook` config you create.

To create your `.monohook`, please refer to the one used for this repository.

Now, symlink the hooks you want managed by monohook:

```
$ ln -s ../../.monohook .git/hooks/pre-commit
$ ln -s ../../.monohook .git/hooks/post-commit
$ ln -s ../../.monohook .git/hooks/pre-rebase
```
